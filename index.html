            <p>We are a well rounded business with high energy and a passion for problem solving, creative thinking, and optimal efficiency. Simply put, we enjoy (re)defining marketplaces with disruptive technologies.  BBIT, at our core, is beyond fascinated with Virtual Reality, Blockchain Protocol, and Quantum Computing. With that being said, we are eager to see where these technologies will take the human race in the years to come!</p>
            <p>In the words of our favorite Entrepreneur, "Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it. And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on. So keep looking until you find it. Don't settle."</p>
